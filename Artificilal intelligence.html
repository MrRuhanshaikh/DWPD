       <i> <Big>Manufacturers in numerous industries have used robots to tackle complex assignments, but now theyâ€™re progressing towards greater utility. They are becoming more flexible, autonomous, and cooperative. And hence, they will interact and work safely with humans and learn from them. These robots and analytics chatbot will be economical and have a more excellent range of capabilities than those used in manufacturing today.
        
        For example, Kuka, a European robotic equipment manufacturer, offers autonomous robots that interact. These robots are interconnected to work together and automatically adjust their actions to fit the next unfinished product in the line. Control units and High-end sensors enable close collaboration with humans.
