        <big><p><align="left"><i>Analytics based on large data sets has come out recently in the world of manufacturing, where it optimizes quality of production, improves equipment service, and saves energy. Big data analytics in Industry 4.0 is in the context that the comprehensive evaluation and collection of data from many different sources—production equipment and systems and organization- and CMS—will become standard to support decision making in real-time.
        
        For example, Infineon Technologies, a semiconductor manufacturer has reduced product failures by correlating single-chip data encapsulated in the testing phase at the end of the production process with process data collated in the wafer status phase in the early process. In this way, industry 4.0 analytics helped Infineon to quickly identify patterns that assist them in discharging faulty chips early in the production process and improved production quality.
