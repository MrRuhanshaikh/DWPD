        <i> <Big>Organizations have begun to adopt additive manufacturing, such as 3-D printing, mostly to produce individual components and prototypes. Having Industry 4.0 in place, these additive-manufacturing methods will be widely used to make small batches of customized products that offer construction advantages, like high performance, lightweight designs, and more. 

            For example, aerospace organizations are using additive manufacturing to apply new designs that reduce aircraft weight and lower expenses for raw materials such as titanium.
