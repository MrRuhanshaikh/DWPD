        <i> <Big>In the current scenario, only some of a manufacturer's machines and sensors are networked and make use of embedded computing. The Industrial Internet of Things is so central to Industry 4.0 that the two terms are used interchangeably. Most of the physical things in Industry 4.0 â€“ devices, machinery, robots, products, equipment, - use sensors to provide real-time data about their performance, condition, or location. 

            This technology lets organizations run smoother supply chains, rapidly modify, and design products, stay on top of consumer preferences, prevent equipment downtime, track products and inventory, and much more.
            
            A drive-and-control-system vendor, Bosch Rexroth, outfitted a production facility for valves with a decentralized production and semi-automated process. Products are identified by identification codes, radiofrequency and workstations to know which manufacturing steps must be performed for each product and can adapt to perform the specific operation.
