        <i> <Big>Augmented-reality-based systems support various services, like sending repair instructions over mobile devices and selecting parts in a warehouse. These systems are currently in their infancy, but in the coming time, organizations will make much broader use of AR to provide workers with real-time information to improve decision-making and work procedures.

            For instance, Siemens has developed a virtual plant-operator training module for its Comos software that uses a realistic, data-based 3-D environment with AR glasses to train their plant personnel to handle emergencies.
